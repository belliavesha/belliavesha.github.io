    <h3>A dummy text. Do not read. </h3>
    <p>
    What is a Mandelbrot set? 
    Everyone knows that, it is a set of such complex numbers c, such that the process, starting from number 0 and applying and reapplying the transformation $z^2 + c$ never diverges to infinity, stays confined within a circle around the origin.
    It is a cool fractal. 
    The said process can also stay confined if it is started with some number, $z_0$. 
    The sed of such numbers $z_0$ is called a Julia set for some parameter c. 
    They are also cool fractals. 
    Moreove, the Mandelbrot set is the set of parameters c, such that the Julia sets are connected. 
    Everyone knows that. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Let's take a number from the Mandelbrot set and appreciate the fact that it parametrizes a function that is applied to a variable which always stays in sight.
    What happens to the variable? 
    Everyone knows that, if it is in the main cardioid, the process has a limit. 
    Which is boring.
    If it is not, then it starts oscilating between n 'states', however, we can pick every n'th number from this sequence and then they are going to have a limit.
    Finally, if the number is exactly on the border of the set, then the process is chaotic and goes all around other points from the exact border of the set. 
    Which is cool. 
    But I still declare this to be rather boring, because everyone knows that. 
    </p><p>
    In search for something interestin, I first acknowledge the fact that we deal with sequences.  
    The sequences are defined with a start number $z_0$ and a parameter c, and the function between consequtive numbers never change, so let's change that. 
    Now the wequence is defined with therule $z_n = f(z_{n-1}, c, n)$. 
    But this is too random any sequence can be described like that. 
    I want the dependence on n to be simple, confined, orderly and natural. 
    Like a circle. 
    </p><p>

    Now we have $f(z, c, n) =  z^2 + c e^{in}$, let's play with it. Beneath is the new Mandelbrot and Julia sets. 
    But the numbers of the sequences now align in some wiggly loops. Which is not boring.

    <p>
    But in our quadratic function we completely omitted the linear term. 
    Which is a miss. 
    We can add it also as yet one more paramter: $f(z, c, n) =  z^2 + c_1 z \cos(n) - c_0 \sin(n)$. 
    Playing with the two parameters now, we can observe even wigglier loops.
